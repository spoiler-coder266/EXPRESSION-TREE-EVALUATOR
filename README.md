📊 Expression Tree Evaluator
🧠 Project Description
The Expression Tree Evaluator is an application designed to parse and evaluate complex mathematical expressions using expression trees. The system supports variables, mathematical functions, and applies optimizations to simplify expressions. Additionally, it offers a visual representation of expression trees and traces the step-by-step evaluation of expressions.

🚀 Features
Parse mathematical expressions into tree structures

Evaluate expressions using tree traversal

Support for variables and constants

Built-in mathematical functions

Expression simplification and optimization

Expression tree visualization

Step-by-step evaluation tracing

🏗️ Implementation Steps
Node Design
Create distinct classes for:

Operators (+, -, *, /, etc.)

Operands (constants and variables)

Functions (e.g., sin, cos, log)

Parsing Engine
Implement a parser using recursive descent parsing to convert expressions into an expression tree, respecting operator precedence and associativity.

Tree-Based Evaluation
Develop algorithms to recursively evaluate the expression tree.

Variable and Constant Support
Enable dynamic input of variables and evaluate expressions with user-defined values.

Mathematical Functions
Build a standard library of supported mathematical functions using accurate numerical methods.

Expression Simplification
Apply rule-based simplification (e.g., x * 0 → 0, x + 0 → x, 2 * x + 3 * x → 5 * x).

Visualization
Design an intuitive graphical representation of expression trees to aid understanding.

Evaluation Tracing
Provide a detailed trace of the evaluation process showing each computational step.
